java spring boot and using MySQL as the database
<br>
didn't implement jwt security so the project isn't exactly finished but all the other stuff is up and running without any errors
<br>
also added swagger for documentation
<br>
got a warning from git guardian for having email id password and setting spring security user,password in applications.properties (used spring.security.user/password so don't need to keep using the spring auto generated password everytime restart the app, since not implemented spring security)
